## Boot-Up Day 3 (Wed, Jul 2)

### Topics Covered
- Singly Linked List: append, prepend, delete, reverse
- Stack (array-based)
- Queue (array-based)

### What I Learned
- Linked Lists are great for dynamic insertions but bad for indexing.
- Stack = LIFO, Queue = FIFO
- Python `list` is efficient as a stack, but for queues, `collections.deque` is better for perf.

### Code Added
- `singly_linked_list.py`
- `stack.py`
- `queue.py`

### Tests
- All unit tests pass via `pytest`
- Pre-commit ran `black` and `isort` on commit
