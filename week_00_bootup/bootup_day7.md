## Week 0 Retrospective

### âœ… What I Accomplished
- Set up Python 3.13 dev env with `black`, `isort`, `pytest`, `rich`
- Implemented & tested:
  - DynamicArray
  - HashMap (separate chaining)
  - Singly Linked List, Stack, Queue
  - Binary Tree + DFS/BFS traversals
  - MinHeap + Binary Search utils
- Reached â‰¥ 90% test coverage
- Got familiar with Git, pytest, VS Code, pre-commit

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Takeaways
- How to write clean, testable helpers
- How to use coverage + pre-commit properly
- Importance of readable code and test-driven workflow

### ðŸ”§ Areas to Improve
- Faster implementation on new structures
- Get more reps with binary search and recursive logic
- Practice explaining code aloud clearly

### ðŸ”œ Ready for Phase 1
- Arrays, Strings, and Patterns start tomorrow
- Will stick to 3Ã— problem/day rhythm + weekly mock
